# Palette Kit Generator

A personal project for a neo-editorial color picker that builds a compact brand kit from a single base colour. The goal is a bold, minimal layout with punchy palette shifts and fast remix controls.

## Approach

- Built a hex-first workflow, so the base colour drives every role in the kit.
- Tuned palette math to create visible jumps when presets are applied.
- Kept the UI tight and legible with a two-column role grid and a focused remix section.

## Technologies Used

- React (component structure)
- HTML + CSS (layout and styling)
- JavaScript (runtime via the React bundle)
